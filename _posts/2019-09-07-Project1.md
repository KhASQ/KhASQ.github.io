This is our first project at Metis boot camp and me with my team worked on it for 3 days to provide a solution for WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY)

## Project request 
>WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.

>To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

>Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

>The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.

## Approach
Our team approached WTWY’s project by analyzing MTA data to help them in with the best subway stations to assign street teams.

We recognize that our client wants to build awareness and reach of women in technology through a summer gala open to everyone that’s interested.

The figure below shows the project approach that we followed

## Project objectives
- To help WomenTechWomensYes (WTWY) organization to optimize the placement of their street teams.
- To provide (WTWY) with business solutions to reduce the cost of their advertisement project.
- To provide (WTWY) with the optimum days and times at top five utilized stations.
- To provide (WTWY) with the optimum UNITS inside each of the five stations.
-To provide (WTWY) with a Pi chart that shows the percentage of utilized stations.

## Data Preprocessing
The MTA turnstile data is quite complex and not immediately useful. Here’s a snippet of the raw data obtained from the MTA:

- STATION is the name of the subway station
- C/A or Control Area is basically a “Fare Control Area”, a vestibule with a booth
- UNIT or remote unit is a bank of turnstiles in the control area.
- SCP is Subunit Channel Position or the unique identifier for the turnstile in that control area.
- ENTRIES and EXITS are the turnstile’s counter. It’s recorded 6 times a day in 4 hour blocks, and it’s a running cumulative total.

  ### Clean Columns name
  Remove any spacing in the end or back of columns name
  ``` python
  Train.columns = [column.strip() for column in list(Train.columns)]
  ```
  ### Finde the defrence for ENTRIES and EXITS
  Shift up one column and substract from the another
  ``` python
  Train['D_ENTRIES'] = Train.ENTRIES.shift(-1)-Train.ENTRIES
Train['D_EXITS'] = Train.EXITS.shift(-1)-Train.EXITS
```
### Outliers
Replace any vlaue by 0 if the vlaue is less than 0 or more thne 4000
``` python
Train = Train[(Train.D_ENTRIES> 0) & (Train.D_ENTRIES < 4000) &
                (Train.D_EXITS > 0) & (Train.D_EXITS < 4000)]
```


## Results
  First, We just look at the subway data and see what kind of information we can gather

  And we make a decision to identify 4 major patterns

  ### 1. Peak Hours (May-2019)

  ### 4. Top busiest units at 34 ST-PENN STA (May-2019)

  ## Our selution
  Based on our Analyses we can provide  a recumndeation for our client to increase the efficiency of the marketing campaign 

###  Recommended Stations
  - 34 ST-PENN STA
  - GRD Central-42 ST
  - 34 ST-Herald SQ
  - 14 ST-Union SQ
  - 32 ST 15

And the number of workers can be assigned based on the percentage in the Pi chart belwe.

###  Recommended Days
- Tuesday
- Monday
- Wednesday

###  Recommended Hours
  - 8:00 AM
  - 12:00 PM
  - 4:00 PM

## Conclusion
It was a really great experience to know the tools and the knowledge to convert larg amount of data to factors that will let you understand what is the behaver of people with subway systems

  Great experience with amazing team
