# Project 03 : Predicting Taxi type based on the Time and location in New York City

This is my third project at Metis Bootcamp and project goals are analyses and predict taxi type by the Pickup location and time


## New York city taxi
In New York City, taxicabs come in two varieties: yellow and green; they are widely recognizable symbols of the city and I want to add Uber data and try to predict taxi type by the Pickup location and time

## Approach

### Getting The Data
Datasets for the yellow and green taxi was collected from [Taxi and Limousine Commission website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and Uber dataset was collected from this [Github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/blob/master/uber-trip-data/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv)

### Data Cleaning
- Remove pickup longitude outlier
- Remove pickup latitude outlier


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Jupyter Notebook was and plotly used for visualizing the data. the figures below shown 3000000 pickups, 1000000 per taxi type and 3 features.

### Model Selection

Using pipeline and gridsearchcv

|       Pipline       	|    Hyperparameters per Model   	| Total of Hyperparameter 	|
|:-------------------:	|:------------------------------:	|:-----------------------:	|
|    Random forest    	| Number of estimators & Max depth 	|            25           	|
| Logistic regression 	|            Penalty & C           	|            21           	|
|    Multinomial NB   	|         Alpha & Fit_prior        	|            4            	|

And based on result the best model is Random forest.

### Model Tuning
With new pipeline and set the Max depth on 10 I let the pipeline tune Number of estimators

And we can see the best number of estimators is 30
