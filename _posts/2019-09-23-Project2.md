# LAPTOPS’ PRICES PREDICTION

This is my second project at Metis Bootcamp and project goals are scraping and analyses Newegg store Laptop data to develop a model that will expect Laptop prices based on laptop features.

## About Newegg.com
Newegg.com is an online retailer of items including computer hardware and consumer electronics. It is based in City of Industry, California, in the United States.

## Approach

### Web scraping
I used BeautifulSoup4 to cloect the data from Newegg
#### Scraping phases 
  ##### 1. Scrap all products Link
  contain Laptops ans store the Laptops links per page
  ##### 2. Store all products source code
  Store product page source code as HTML files in my local machine At this point, there is no theard actor in the scaping process
  ##### 3. Extract features out of source code
  Extract all possible feature that may help the model to predict the price

  Extracted features
  - Price
  - product ID
  - Of 5 rating
  - Review count
  - Product name
  - Product specifications



##### 4. Build data frame

Each scooped data per product stored in a dictionary and the Dataframe will be generated by a list of dictionary
##### 5. Remove duplicate pages
Now and to make sure there are no duplicated intreas py the website or by a mistake in the scaping, I removed any duplicate entries 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Visualizing Data Set
Jupyter Notebook was used for visualizing the data. the figure below shown that I gathered 12766 observations and I used 9 features.
